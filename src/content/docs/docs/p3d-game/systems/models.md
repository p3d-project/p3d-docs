## Import GMO Models into Blender
To import GMO models into Blender, you need to download the [Noesis Model Viewer](https://richwhitehouse.com/index.php?content=inc_projects.php&showproject=91).

Open the GMO in Noesis. You should then see the model load in with textures and animations.

Now, export the GMO model as a .fbx file, with the ```-fbxmultitake -fbxtexrel -fbxascii``` advanced options.
> -fbxmultitake: export the animations individually
> -fbxtexrel: export the animation paths relatively
> -fbxascii: export the fbx in a human-readable text format

Once you have exported the .fbx, you are ready to import the model into Blender!
> **NOTE**: If you run into an issue where the textures will not load, it is most likely they have the wrong path. This is a known issue when using *Noesis via Crossover on MacOS*. You will need to open the .fbx file in a text editor, and update all ```RelativeFilename``` and ```RelPath``` entries to ensure that ```RelativeFilename``` just has file name (no path)

## Optimize Models
To optimize character models, install the nds_model_optimizer.py Blender plugin in tools/plugins/blender.

To use the optimizer:
1. Go into ```Object Mode``` and click "N". On the sidebar, you should see a tab called ```NDS Engine```
2. Click that, and you should see a popup called ```NDS Model Optimizer``` with a ```Optimize Model``` button
3. Now, select the entire model (A) and click ```Optimize Model```. This may take a few minutes
4. Once its down optimizing, on the bottom left of the viewport, there will be a dropdown called ```Optimze Model```. Click that to expand and modify optimization settings.

The most important options under ```Optimize Model``` are
- Target poly ratio: Modifying this value changes how 'optimized' the models become. The recommended value is around 0.70.

## Export Models from Blender
To export models from Blender, you need to install and use our custom Blender extension. This extension can be found in tools/plugins/blender & is called ```nds_model_exporter.py```.

To install a Blender plugin, go into ```Edit -> Preferences```.

Once you have installed the plugin, you must ensure that the plugin is **enabled** (checkmark).

The plugin is now installed! To actually export your model, simply go to ```File -> Export -> NDS Model (.zip)```. Note that exporting may take some time.
